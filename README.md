## Hi, I'm Yiannis

I'm mostly into supercomputing, C++, and AI. I received my Ph.D. for my work on runtime systems for HPC systems from [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/); you can find my dissertation at the [Texas A&M University Libraries](https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nde41f596/Documents/View%20All).

These days I am a software engineer at [AMD Research and Advanced Development (RAD)](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research.html).

### 👷 Notable Work

- [**intellikit**](https://github.com/AMDResearch/intellikit) (as [ypapadop-amd](https://github.com/ypapadop-amd)): I've been building intellikit, a suite of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that give LLMs structured access to performance engineering workflows, bridging the gap between AI assistants and software optimization for AMD products.
- [**ROCr**](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/rocr-runtime) (as [ypapadop-amd](https://github.com/ypapadop-amd)): I contribute to the foundational layers of the ROCm ecosystem - most recently extending the ROCm Runtime (ROCr) to expose AMD's XDNA NPU architecture, bringing AI accelerator support into the same runtime fabric that drives GPU compute.
- [**MLIR-AIE**](https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie) and [***IRON***](https://github.com/amd/IRON) (as [ypapadop-amd](https://github.com/ypapadop-amd)): Contributing to IRON, a close-to-metal toolkit that empowers performance engineers to create fast and efficient designs for Ryzen™ AI NPUs powered by AI Engines.
- [**STAPL**](https://parasol-lab.gitlab.io/stapl-home/): I developed the STAPL Runtime System (STAPL-RTS) which is the platform abstraction layer of the [STAPL framework](http://parasol-lab.gitlab.io/stapl-home/), a parallel superset of the C++ Standard Template Library. STAPL-RTS offers seemless parallel algorithm composition for large-scale computations by introducing asynchronous nested parallelism support. It provides a novel consistency model, and a unified distributed/shared memory communication and task scheduling primitives. The work demonstrated that parallel algorithm composition at scale doesn't sacrifice programmability. STAPL-RTS was developed as part of my Ph.D. dissertation under the supervision of [Dr. Lawrence Rauchwerger](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/people/rwerger/).
